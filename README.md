## CodeCryptoProjects

This repo contains the code developed for the projects done throughout the CodeCrypto Academy's Blockchain Engineer Master's course. While the original course repository contains all the course-related materials, including exercises, assignments, and miscellaneous code snippets, this repository is designed to focus solely on the projects that best represent my abilities and achievements throughout the course. By creating this dedicated space, I aim to provide a clear and organized view of my project development journey.
